# Real-Time-Disk-Scheduler
The objective of the disk scheduler project is to design and implement efficient disk scheduling algorithms in operating systems. This involves studying and analyzing different scheduling techniques such as FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and more. The project aims to develop a software module capable of optimizing disk I/O performance by selecting the most appropriate scheduling algorithm based on system workload and characteristics. Additionally, it seeks to evaluate the performance of these algorithms through simulations and practical experiments to assess their effectiveness in reducing disk seek time and enhancing overall system throughput.
